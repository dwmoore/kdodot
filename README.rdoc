== README

This is my version of the Team Treehouse Odot series.  Here are the milestones so far:

1. Had a controller mishap when I mistakenly ran a generator with the wrong fields. This resulted in a branch to revert to an earlier state and resume development.  Corrected the isseue and merged the branch back to master.

2. CSS, Table and H1 changes at the end of the video break several tests, which seem to go undocumented in the tutorial.  The issues are mostly in the todo_items specs and corresponging views.  BTW, Thanks guys for the cut and paste 2 seconds of video on the css... That was fun to pause and copy.  Maybe we could get that in the notes below the vid?

Hopefully this will both show some of my early progress as well as help those who come along behind.  More to come...

Cheers!
